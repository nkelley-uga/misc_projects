# misc_projects

Just some random things for that pre-post-grad limbo. Apparently I'm an easy victim for situational projects. Good thing we're living in a time where there are gamuts of gamuts of posibility.

**Contents:**

1. ga-covid-deaths.ipynb : I didn't like how the GA DPH built their COVID report, so I made a better graph in matplotlib and Tableau
2. tweet_scraping.ipynb : quick-start to gathering Twitter data for either static or streaming datasets
